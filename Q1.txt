Implement GitLab Operations using Git.
Task 1: Creating a Repository
● Sign in to your GitLab account.
● Click the "New" button to create a new project.
● Choose a project name, visibility level (public, private), and other settings.
● Click "Create project."
Task 2: Cloning a Repository
● Open your terminal or command prompt.
● Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
● Copy the repository URL from GitLab.
● Run the following command: git clone <repository_url>
● Replace <repository_url> with the URL you copied from GitLab.
● This will clone the repository to your local machine.
Task 3: Making Changes and Creating a Branch
● Navigate into the cloned repository: cd <repository_name>
● Create a new text file named "example.txt" using a text editor.
● Add some content to the "example.txt" file.
● Save the file and return to the command line.
● Check the status of the repository: git status
● Stage the changes for commit: git add example.txt
● Commit the changes with a descriptive message:
git commit -m "Add content to example.txt"
● Create a new branch named "feature": git branch feature
● Switch to the "feature" branch: git checkout feature
Task 4: Pushing Changes to GitLab
● Add Repository URL in a variable git remote add origin <repository_url>
● Replace <repository_url> with the URL you copied from GitLab.
● Push the "feature" branch to GitLab: git push origin feature
● Check your GitLab repository to confirm that the new branch "feature" is 
available.
Task 5: Collaborating through Merge Requests
1. Create a merge request on GitLab:
 Go to the repository on GitLab.
 Click on "Merge Requests" and then "New Merge Request."
 Choose the source branch ("feature") and the target branch ("main" or master").
 Review the changes and click "Submit merge request."
2. Review and merge the merge request:
 Add a title and description for the merge request.
 Assign reviewers if needed.
 Once the merge request is approved, merge it into the target branch.
Task 6: Syncing Changes
● After the merge request is merged, update your local repository:
git checkout main, git pull origin main
